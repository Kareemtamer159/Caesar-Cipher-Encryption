# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

A simple yet elegant **Python command-line application** to **encode** and **decode** secret messages using the **classic Caesar Cipher** 🔁🔠 — the ancient encryption method with a modern twist 💡.

> ✅ **Perfect for situations where sensitive or important messages need to be protected**. Whether you're sharing secrets, storing private notes, or just having fun — Caesar Cipher keeps your messages safe 🔒.

## ✨ Features

- 🔏 **Encrypt (Encode)** any message using a custom shift value  
- 🔓 **Decrypt (Decode)** messages back to their original form  
- 💡 Handles **non-alphabetic characters** (they stay unchanged!)  
- 🤖 **User-friendly interface** with clear prompts  
- 🎨 Fun and engaging **ASCII art logo**  
- 😄 Emojis everywhere to make your experience enjoyable

## 🧠 How It Works

The **Caesar Cipher** is a substitution cipher where each letter in your message is **shifted** a certain number of places up or down the alphabet.

> For example, with a shift of `3`:  
> `a` ➡️ `d`, `b` ➡️ `e`, ..., `z` ➡️ `c`  

It **wraps around** the alphabet, so you’ll never lose a character — just transform it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. 🧬 **Clone or download** this repository  
2. 🐍 Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine  
3. ▶️ Run the script:

```bash
python Caesar_Cipher.py
```

## Follow the prompts:
- Choose whether to encode 🔐 or decode 🔓
- Enter your message 💬
- Provide your preferred shift number 🔢
- Get the result instantly ⚡
- Choose to go again or gracefully exit 🚪

🧪 Example Run
```bash
🧭 Type 'encode' 🔏 to encrypt, or 'decode' 🔓 to decrypt:
👉 encode
💬 Type your message:
👉 hello world
🔢 Type the shift number (e.g. 3):
👉 3
🔐 Encoded message ⛓️: khoor zruog
```
